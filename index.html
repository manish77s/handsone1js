<h2>Q.8 Whatâ€™s the difference between window vs document?</h2>
<h2>Ans= The window and document objects are both related to JavaScript execution inside the browser
     The window object is the global object that represents the browser window, while the document object is a property of the window object that represents the HTML document loaded in that window. Both objects can be used to access the DOM elements, but some events, like scroll and resize, must be attached to the window object. There is no functional difference between using window or document, it is a matter of preference.</h2>
